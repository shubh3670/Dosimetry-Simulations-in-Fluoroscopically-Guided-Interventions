<h1> Dosimetry-Simulations-in-Fluoroscopically-Guided-Interventions</h1>

<p>The National Cancer Institute recently made available a Monte-Carlo-based tool called NCIRF for estimating patient dosimetry – peak skin dose, organ doses, and effective dose – from radiography and fluoroscopy procedures. Inputs such as x-ray technique parameters, dose-area product, phantom age, gender, and size, irradiated field size, c-arm angles, and x-ray field location relative to phantom isocenter are combined to produce estimated dose outputs. This tool is quite beneficial because patient- and procedure-specific dose estimates are only possible when each irradiated field can be mapped directly to a comparable patient phantom for dose computation. Our group has already explored the NCIRF tool for many general aspects of simulated image-guided interventions and their impact on patient dosimetry estimates.

In this project, >100,000 simulated radiation events and their dosimetry outputs will be used to analyze the effects of input parameter variations on dosimetry output values. Data analysis tools such as principal component analysis (PCA) or sensitivity analysis will be used to explore two main objectives: 

1)    identify the most critical input parameters with the strongest impact on variations in dose outputs

2)    estimate the precision needed for each input parameter to maintain dose output uncertainty to <5% and <10%</p>
